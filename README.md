## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They aspire to understand the demand for shared bikes. They want to understand factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends, especially in American market

They have a dataset on the daily bike demands based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this dataset to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.

Essentially, the company wants to know â€”

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- Train dataset R^2 : 0.830
- Test dataset R^2 : 0.794
- Demand of bikes depend on below mentioned feature :
    -yr
    -windspeed
    -temp
    -season_spring
    -season_summer
    -season_winter
    -mnth_Sept
    -weekday_Tues
    -weathersit_B
    -weathersit_C
